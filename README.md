# Data-Intensive-Computation
Big Data course and project work

The course covers a variety of technological tools that enable cloud computing services. Various topics covered include distributed file systems, NoSQL databases, processing data-at-rest (batch data) and data-in-motion (streaming data), graph processing, and resource management. There are 3 intensive lab assignments with real-world datasets using HBase, HDFS, Cassandra, Kafka, and Apache Spark.

The final project in Big Data analysis involves time-series YouTube dataset of trends in several countries. The goal of the project was to use the Big Data tools to analyze data after performing data cleaning tasks such as MapReduce. Trends were analyzed and Machine Learning was performed using MLlib to select the best models for predicting parameters given the others.
